    This is a channel-wide file that applies to many subdirs.  It must have a function with this signature:

    def _patch_repodata(repodata, subdir):

    That function must return a dictionary of patch instructions, of the form:

    {
        ""patch_instructions_version"": 1,
        ""packages"": defaultdict(dict),
        ""revoke"": [],
        ""remove"": [],
    }

    revoke and remove are lists of filenames. remove makes the file not show up
    in the index (it may still be downloadable with a direct URL to the file).
    revoke makes packages uninstallable by adding an unsatisfiable dependency.
    This can be made installable by including a channel that has that package
    (to be created by @jjhelmus).

    packages is a dictionary, where keys are package filenames. Values are
    dictionaries similar to the contents of each package in repodata.json. Any
    values in provided in packages here overwrite the values in repodata.json.
    Any value set to None is removed.

    When converting the bin/ directory to Scripts/, only scripts
    need to be changed. Sometimes the /bin directory contains other
    files that are not Python scripts such as post-link.sh scripts.
    This test converts a packaege that contains a post-link.sh script
    in the bin/ directory and checks to see that its filename remains
    the same.
