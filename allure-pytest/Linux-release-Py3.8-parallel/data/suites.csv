    This is a channel-wide file that applies to many subdirs.  It must have a function with this signature:

    revoke and remove are lists of filenames. remove makes the file not show up

    revoke makes packages uninstallable by adding an unsatisfiable dependency.
    This can be made installable by including a channel that has that package
    (to be created by @jjhelmus).

    packages is a dictionary, where keys are package filenames. Values are
    dictionaries similar to the contents of each package in repodata.json. Any

    Any value set to None is removed.

    A multi-part test encompassing the following checks:

    1. That git submodules identified with both relative and absolute URLs can be mirrored
       and cloned.

    2. That changes pushed to the original repository are updated in the mirror and finally
       reflected in the package version and filename via `GIT_DESCRIBE_TAG`.

    3. That `source.py` is using `check_call_env` and `check_output_env` and that those
       functions are using tools from the build env.

    When converting the bin/ directory to Scripts/, only scripts

    This test converts a packaege that contains a post-link.sh script
